As someone that loves to divvy all over the city I wanted to see how the people of chicago feel about the bike adventures. The project takes in data about the hourly weather data for the chicagoland area and compares that to the divvy trip data in the month of Feburary. 
The end goal is to have a visual dashboard to see how the change in weather affects the number of divvy trips.

Weather data gathered from https://www.visualcrossing.com/

The Questions I am trying to answer:
1. What is the correlation between the weather and the number of divvy trips
2. Does the average trip duration change based on weather
3. Are people more likely to have dockless trips in bad weather
4. When is there the highest volume of trips

Future Expandability into making this a webscraping project to add more weather and divvy data
